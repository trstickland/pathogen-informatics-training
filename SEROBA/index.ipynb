    "# Serotype detection using SeroBA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "SeroBA is a software tool for identifying the serotype of samples from Illumina reads. This tutorial will walk you through using SeroBA for serotyping of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more in depht information about SeroBA, please refer to the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **SeroBA: rapid high-throughput serotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae from whole genome sequence data**\n",

    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you can expect to be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand serotyping, why it is important and what it can be used for\n",
    "* Run SeroBA on several samples to predict their serotype\n",
    "* Summarise the SeroBA results for several samples\n",
    "* Interpret the detailed output of SeroBA\n",
    "* Download and prepare the S. pneumoniae databases from PneumoCAT for use with SeroBA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial sections\n",
    "This tutorial comprises the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [What is serotyping?](serotyping.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [Preparation of databases before running SeroBA](db_setup.ipynb)\n",
    "3. [Running SeroBA](run_seroba.ipynb)\n",
    "4. [Interpreting the results of SeroBA](seroba_results.ipynb)\n",

    "## Authors\n",
    "This tutorial was created by [Sara Sjunnebo](https://github.com/ssjunnebo).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the commands from this tutorial\n",
    "You can run the commands in this tutorial either directly from the Jupyter notebook (if using Jupyter), or by typing the commands in your terminal window. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Running commands on Jupyter\n",
    "If you are using Jupyter, command cells (like the one below) can be run by selecting the cell and clicking _Cell -> Run_ from the menu above or using _ctrl Enter_ to run the command. Let's give this a try by printing our working directory using the _pwd_ command and listing the files within it. Run the commands in the two cells below."
