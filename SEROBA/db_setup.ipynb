When deciding on a k-mer size, it is worth knowing that while a smaller k-mer size can keep the memory requirements low, it will also reduce the specificity. On the other hand, a larger k-mer size will require a larger amount of memory but will produce more unique k-mers and thus increase the specificity. What k-mer size to use also depends on the read length."
