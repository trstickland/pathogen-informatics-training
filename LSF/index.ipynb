    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A single laptop or desktop PC may be used to process, analyse and visualise biological datasets. However, these datasets can be quite large, making computational analysis on a single machine painfully slow and sometimes impossible. In these situations, a compute farm can be used to run the analysis more efficiently. In this tutorial, we will look at what a compute farm is and how we can use a job manager, such as LSF, to perform computational tasks more efficiently.\n",

    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "On completion of the tutorial, you can expect to be able to:\n",

    "* view cluster structure using LSF\n",
    "* view queue information using LSF\n",
    "* submit and manage jobs using LSF\n",
    "* submit job arrays using LSF\n",
    "* submit dependent jobs using LSF\n",
    "* understand priority and fairshare in LSF\n",

    "If you are using Jupyter, command cells (like the one below) can be run by selecting the cell and clicking _Cell -> Run_ from the menu above or using _ctrl Enter_ to run the command. Let's give this a try by printing our working directory using the _pwd_ command and listing the files within it. Run the commands in the two cells below."
