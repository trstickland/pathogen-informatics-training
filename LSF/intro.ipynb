    "\n",
    "A cluster is a set of connected computers (**nodes** or **hosts**) which work together. When you log in to the cluster from your local machine, you will most likely be connecting to the **head node**. The head node handles the submission of the computational tasks you want to perform. These tasks are then passed on to the **compute nodes** where they will subsequently be run."

    "You don't have to log into the head node, you can also log in to a compute node. When you log into the head node, you can use it to submit your jobs, migrate data between file systems and housekeeping. However, you should _**not**_ be running computationally intensive jobs on the head node outside of LSF."

    "When analysing data on a single machine, such as a laptop, commands or scripts are run in the terminal and the results are given back via the terminal. On a cluster, we need to run these commands or scripts as **jobs**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resources required to run the jobs may not always be available straight away, so the jobs get submitted into a **queue**. A queue is a list of jobs which are waiting for resources (pending) or being executed (running). As jobs in the queue finish executing, the resources they were using become available again and the next job in the queue will start running. \n",
    "\n",
    "Job scheduling and execution is controlled by the platform load sharing facility (**LSF**) which manages the workload."
