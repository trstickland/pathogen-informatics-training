    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your list of differentially expressed (DE) genes, the next step is often to ask whether the DE genes associated with a particular biological process or function.  To do this, we can perform a gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis. A gene ontology (GO) is a controlled vocabulary which describes gene products from in any organism (i.e. species agnostic). These descriptions are broken down into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **molecular function (MF)**\n",
    "  _what the gene product does_\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **biological process (BP)**\n",
    "  _why the gene product does this_\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **cell component (CC)**\n",
    "  _where the gene product acts_\n",
    "  \n",
    "DEAGO uses **[topGO](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/topGO.html)** to compare a target gene list (e.g. your DE genes) to the background (all genes) and identifies GO terms which are significantly enriched or over-represented in your gene list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this part of the tutorial are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * run a GO analysis with DEAGO\n",
    "  * interpret the output GO report from DEAGO\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Input files\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to give DEAGO three bits of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * *the name/location of the directory containing our gene count files (counts)*\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * *the name/location of our sample/condition mapping file (targets.txt)*\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * *the name/location of our formatted annotation file (ensembl_mm10_deago_formatted.tsv)*\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Running a GO analysis with DEAGO\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplest command to run a GO analysis with DEAGO the command would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "deago -c <counts_directory> -t <targets file> -a <annotation file> --go\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To indicate that we want to run a GO analysis, we use the `--go` option. Notice here that we **must** provide a formatted annotation file using the `-a` option as we need to know the GO terms assoicated with each gene for the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as before, our count files were generated by featureCounts for this tutorial, so we need to also tell DEAGO the count format with the `--count_type` option:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "deago -c <counts_directory> -t <targets file> -a <annotation file> --go \\\n",
    "    --count_type featurecounts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also using the `--control` option, as before, which tells DEAGO the condition you want to use as your reference or control, in this case **WT_Ctrl**. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "deago -c <counts_directory> -t <targets file> -a <annotation file> --go\\\n",
    "    --count_type featurecounts --control <control>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output files\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your GO analysis has finished, you should see several new files and directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`deago.config`**  \n",
    "  _config file with key/value parameters defining the analysis_  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`deago.rlog`**  \n",
    "  _log of the R output generated when converting the R markdown to HTML_  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`deago_markdown.Rmd`**  \n",
    "  _R markdown used to run the analysis_  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`deago_markdown.html`**  \n",
    "  _HTML report generated from the R markdown_  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **`results_<timestammp>`**  \n",
    "  _directory containing unfiltered DE analysis results and normalised counts for all genes, one file per contrast_\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Results directory\n",
    "\n",
    "DEAGO also writes the GO term enrichment analysis results tables containing the top 30 significantly enriched GO terms to individual files, split by GO term level (MF and BP), in your timestamped results directory. If possible, there will be three GO tables for each GO term level containing the results for analyses using all genes, up-regulated genes only and down-regulated genes\n",
    "\n",
    "  * [contrast]_BP.tsv\n",
    "  * [contrast]_BP_up.tsv\n",
    "  * [contrast]_BP_down.tsv\n",
